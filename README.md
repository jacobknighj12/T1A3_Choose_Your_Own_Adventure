# T1A3_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure

A game for those looking for a story based adventure with plenty of choices along the way.

Getting the Development plan out of the way, after the class had just gone over a limited choice recsource based app, I was feeling the creativity so I wanted to make a short story based choose your own adventure with recourses and a main focus on story, correct choices and plot developments, this stems from an old goosebumps interactive novel I had as a child and feel an impulse to use that as an idea, elements I would like to include would be a 4th wall breaking mechanic from a game called "One Shot" of creating files and illuding to the fact of where they might be or forcefully opening them to create a sense of involvement in the story unlike others.
So, deeper, The user will be able to input their name and may be in either first or third person to themselves or another charecter. currently undecided.
after that the game will explain in the simplest terms possible of how to interact, that you can only use one of the listed options, to make sure there are no
grammatical or punctuation errors to ensure best experience while playing, the basic mechanics, rescourses, and how hard the game will be and that their choices will greatly
affect the game and story, as well as having unintened dead ends to the story through their actions (hopfully deservingly and not to surprise them by giving false direction with prompts)
having at least one puzzle in the game, and at least one interaction between the user and the pc they are playing from. finally at least 2 endings that can result from different player actions that can serve as either a moral compass or just due to how well they played the game.

The problems this will be solving are:

- Current lack of adventure
- Escapeism as many right now will be feeling trapped and alone
- A entertaining(hopefully) way to spend some inside time
  The target audience will be people that are at least enough versed to understand the requirements to run the app and be able to enjoy it,
  the age demographic it will be targeting is probably 16+/MA there will be some horror themes so it is not aimed at a young demographic but
  any old enough to enjoy it and any tech litterate enough to operate it, it will be thouroughly explained on how to install and run however getting
  enviroments set up is not exactly an easy task even for very tech litterate people.

The basic user interactions will be through varied prompts that will come up after reading out a scene and may or may not affect progression or rescources
in a text format displayed in a terminal capable of running the current ruby 2.7.2 and will require at least one gem as a dependancy.
